# GenAI for Software Development (Prompting)

# **1. Introduction**  
This project examines the role that prompt engineering plays in optimizing the efficiency, accuracy, and readability for various software engineering tasks, such as code generation, debugging, and documentation.


The project uses established prompting strategies (namely zero-shot, few-shot, persona/role-playing, chain-of-thought, prompt chaining, and self-consistency) to compare and contrast the efficacy of two generative models.
